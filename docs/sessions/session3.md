3. **Edit Parameters in Power BI Desktop**  
   In Power BI Desktop, go to **Edit Parameters**. Paste the connection string into the **server** parameter.  
   > *Tip: If your Lakehouse is named differently than `lh_demo`, update the database parameter accordingly. Click **OK** and then **Apply changes**.*

5. **Configure Q&A Synonyms**  
   Open **Q&A Tooling** (gear icon) and go to the **Synonyms** tab. Add 3â€“5 business synonyms for each key field (e.g., add "revenue" as a synonym for *Sales Amount*).

6. **Clean Up Field Names**  
   Hide key columns and rename any cryptic columns to friendly business names (e.g., rename `ProductID` to **Product ID**).

7. **Checkpoint: Review Your Model**  
   Verify that all tables are related, names are readable, and no errors appear in the model.  
   > *Discuss with your group: Does your model meet best practices?*

8. **Publish the Updated Model**  
   Save and publish the updated model back to your workspace.  
   *Optional: Compare your model to the **Copilot in Fabric â€“ Clean** model included in the downloaded content.*

9. **Practice Prompts**  
   Re-run the following prompts from Session 2 and compare the visuals and answers. You should see improved results.  
   *Copy each prompt using the copy button:*

    ```text
    Show total sales by product category.
    ```

    ```text
    Create year-over-year sales growth measure. Explain the DAX.
    ```

    ```text
    Create an executive dashboard showing total sales, profit %, and top 5 products.
    ```

    ```text
    Summarize this page in three bullet points.
    ```

10. **Best Practices Reflection**  
    With your table-mates, compile a checklist of best practices: clear names, synonyms, star schema, and realistic expectations for Copilot.
